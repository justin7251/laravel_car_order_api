## About Laravel Car Order Api

Laravel Car Order Api is a small API application using the Laravel framework. The app allows third parties to send car purchase orders to this API and then store the data for CRUD use. I also created Laravel Schedule task to delete data older than 3 days.

# CRUD
| Verb | Path | Action | Route Name
| :---:   | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| POST | /api/orders | store | orders.store
| GET | /api/orders/{uuid} | show | orders.show
| PUT/PATCH | /api/orders/{uuid}| update | orders.update

# Used
- Laravel 8
- PHP 7.4
- Docker
- mysql 5.7.22

## Installation
1. extra zip file then go into the extra folder
2. Install Composer packages [composer install]
3. Install Docker
4. Run Docker [docker-compose up]
5. Once the Database has been connected (Detail can be found .env)
6. Open a new terminal run command [php artisan migrate:fresh]


## Testing
1. I have created a phpunit test on tests/Feature/OrderApiTest.php
If you would like to run the test ensure docker is up the run[docker-compose exec laravel_car_order_api php ./vendor/bin/phpunit]
2. I have create a REST Client Plugin test (test.http)

## Possible improvement 
1. PHP Application is much slower running in Docker and if OpCache is being install it can imporve the performance from running the code in shared memory. 

2. A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.[F5][1]It helps divide traffic and ensure high availability and reliability of services by only sending requests to servers that are online.

3. Security is my last but not least area to be imporve, the API request contain a simple field validation, but there might be more work to do, e.g try catch on exception error, text into clean up on any tags <script>.
Lastly, I would also like to setup OAuth 2.0 for API authentication and authorization standard protects user data by providing access to the data without revealing the userâ€™s identity or credentials.
